What took you so long?
Well, you know, Master, I couldn't find a speeder that I really liked...
There he is.
...with an open cockpit and the right speed capabilities.
If you spent as much time practicing your saber techniques as you did your wit,
you'd rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.
I thought I already did.
Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.
